# HugeNumberLibrary


## Goal

The goal is to create a fast, memory efficient library for huge numbers in C++. With huge I mean widely beyond anything that can be stored exactly, like the numbers described [here](https://googology.wikia.org/wiki/Googology_Wiki).

## Use

The goal is to be able to import a new type which overloads all of the operators you expect from numbers.

## Implementation

Internally the numbers will be stored using an easily extendable custom number notation.
